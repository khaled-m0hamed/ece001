Advantages of AI:
1) Automates the processes.Artificial Intelligence allows robots to develop repetitive, routine and process optimization tasks automatically and without human intervention.
2) Enhance creative tasks. AI frees people from routine and repetitive tasks and allows them to spend more time on creative functions.
3) Provides precision.The application of AI is capable of providing greater precision than humans, for example in industrial environments, machines can make decisions that were previously made manually or monitored without AI.
4) Reduces time spent on data analysis. It allows the analysis and exploitation of the data derived from production to be carried out in real time.
Disadvantage of AI:
1) High cost: creation of artificial intelligence requires huge costs as they are very complex machines. Their repair and maintenance require huge costs.
2) No replicating humans: intelligence is believed to be a gift of nature. An ethical argument continues, whether human intelligence is to be replicated or not.
3) No improvement with experience: Unlike humans, artificial intelligence cannot be improved with experience. With time, it can lead to wear and tear. It stores a lot of data but the way it can be accessed and used is very different from human intelligence.
4) Unemployment: Replacement of humans with machines can lead to large-scale unemployment. Unemployment is a socially undesirable phenomenon. People with nothing to do can lead to the destructive use of their creative minds.
